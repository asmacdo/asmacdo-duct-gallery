# CLI Interface Contract: con-duct-gallery

## Command
```bash
con-duct-gallery [OPTIONS]
```

## Optional Arguments
- `--gallery-dir PATH` - Gallery directory to scan (default: `./gallery`)

## Output Location
- Always writes to `README.md` in repository root (current working directory)

## Exit Codes
- `0` - Success, markdown generated
- `1` - Error (invalid arguments, no entries found, execution failures, write failures)

## Standard Output
- Progress messages during execution
- Entry processing status
- Success confirmation with output path

## Standard Error
- Warning messages for skipped entries
- Error messages for failures
- Execution error details

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
con-duct-gallery
```

**Output**:
```
Scanning gallery directory: ./gallery
Found 3 entries
Executing entry: example-1
  Running setup.sh...
  Running command.sh...
  Generating plot...
Executing entry: example-2
  Running setup.sh...
  Running command.sh...
  Generating plot...
Executing entry: example-3
  Running setup.sh...
  Running command.sh...
  Generating plot...
Generated markdown: README.md (3 entries)
```

### Custom Gallery Directory
```bash
con-duct-gallery --gallery-dir /data/experiments
```

### Warning: Entry Execution Failed
```bash
con-duct-gallery
```

**stderr**:
```
Warning: Entry 'bad-entry' skipped - setup.sh failed with exit code 1
```

**stdout**:
```
Scanning gallery directory: ./gallery
Found 2 entries
Executing entry: good-entry
  Running setup.sh...
  Running command.sh...
  Generating plot...
Generated markdown: README.md (1 entry)
```

**Exit code**: 0 (warnings don't cause failure)

### Error: No Entries Found
```bash
con-duct-gallery --gallery-dir empty/
```

**stderr**:
```
Error: No valid gallery entries found in empty/
```

**Exit code**: 1

## Behavioral Contract

### Execution Order
1. Scan gallery directory
2. Validate each entry (skip invalid, log warnings)
3. Execute entries sequentially
4. Generate markdown
5. Write to README.md in current directory

### Error Handling
- **Fatal errors** (exit 1): No entries found, write failures to README.md
- **Non-fatal errors** (warnings, continue): Individual entry execution failures

### Idempotency
- Same gallery directory + same arguments â†’ same output content (deterministic)
- Execution is repeatable
- Datalad provenance preserved for each run

### File System Effects
- Reads from: `<gallery-dir>/*/{setup.sh,command.sh,metadata.json}`
- Writes to: `<gallery-dir>/*/{.duct/,plots/}` (via duct/con-duct execution)
- Writes to: `README.md` in current working directory

### Performance Expectations
- Total time = sum of all entry execution times + tool overhead
- Tool overhead (scanning, markdown generation): <5 seconds for 100 entries
- Entry execution time: depends entirely on duct command duration
  (could be seconds for quick commands, hours for long-running processes)
