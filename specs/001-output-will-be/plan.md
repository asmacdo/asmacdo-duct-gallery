# Implementation Plan: Gallery Markdown Output

**Branch**: `001-output-will-be` | **Date**: 2025-10-03 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/home/austin/devel/asmacdo-duct-gallery/specs/001-output-will-be/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Generate a consolidated markdown file containing all gallery entries with their duct execution commands (as code blocks) and corresponding resource plots. Output is user-configurable, generation is on-demand, and the system assumes plots are pre-generated by automation. Initial implementation supports one plot per entry with minimal metadata.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (for con-duct integration and file operations)
**Primary Dependencies**: Python standard library (pathlib, argparse), con-duct (for plot metadata), datalad (for provenance)
**Storage**: File system (reads gallery/ entries, writes markdown output)
**Testing**: pytest with integration tests for markdown generation
**Target Platform**: Linux (primary), cross-platform compatible
**Project Type**: Single project (CLI tool for gallery rendering)
**Performance Goals**: Generate markdown for 100+ entries in <5 seconds
**Constraints**: Must not modify gallery entries, read-only access, idempotent generation
**Scale/Scope**: Initial: 10-50 gallery entries, design for 100+

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**I. Reproducibility-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**
- [x] All gallery entries can be fully reproduced from scratch (N/A: tool reads existing entries, doesn't create them)
- [x] Duct commands documented and re-runnable (N/A: reads commands from entries)
- [x] Con-duct plots regeneratable from duct outputs (N/A: reads pre-generated plots)
- [x] All operations use `datalad run` for provenance (Will use datalad run for markdown generation)
- [x] Entry validity verified by regeneration test (Tool validates entry structure during read)

**II. Automation Over Manual Steps**
- [x] Gallery generation fully automated (CLI tool, no manual steps)
- [x] Manual steps limited to: curation, initial setup, debugging (Trigger only)
- [x] CI/CD validates reproducibility (Tool can be run in CI)
- [x] Scripts preferred over documentation for operations (Pure script-based tool)

**III. Test-First Development**
- [x] Tests written before implementation (Integration tests in quickstart.md)
- [x] Gallery entries serve as reproducibility test cases (Tool validates entry format)
- [x] Red-Green-Refactor cycle followed (TDD approach in implementation)
- [x] No implementation without failing tests (Tests written in Phase 1)

**IV. Simplicity & Maintainability**
- [x] Code readable by non-experts (Simple file reading + markdown generation)
- [x] Simple solutions over clever ones (Direct approach, no frameworks)
- [x] Common design patterns used (Iterator pattern for entries, template pattern for markdown)
- [x] "Why" documented, not "what" (Document design decisions)
- [x] Small atomic changes (Feature broken into tasks)
- [x] YAGNI principle applied (Minimal metadata, single plot, no bells/whistles)

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure. This is a CLI tool that reads from `gallery/` directory and outputs a consolidated markdown file. The tool itself is simple: entry discovery → markdown generation → file write. No database, no API, just file I/O and text generation.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/)
- CLI setup tasks (entrypoint, argparse, main loop)
- Entry model creation task (GalleryEntry class)
- Entry discovery and validation tasks
- Script execution wrapper tasks (setup.sh, command.sh)
- Plot generation task (con-duct integration)
- Markdown renderer task
- Integration test tasks from quickstart.md scenarios
- Each independent module → mark [P] for parallel

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Setup → Models → Execution → Rendering → Integration
- Entry discovery before execution
- Execution before plot generation
- Plot generation before markdown rendering
- Mark [P] for parallel: model tests, unit tests for independent modules

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**Key Task Categories**:
1. Setup (project structure, dependencies, CLI entrypoint)
2. Tests (integration test fixtures from quickstart.md)
3. Core (GalleryEntry model, entry discovery)
4. Execution (script executor, con-duct plot wrapper)
5. Rendering (markdown generator, path resolver)
6. Integration (end-to-end pipeline, error handling)

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [x] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete

**Artifacts Generated**:
- [x] research.md - Technology decisions and implementation notes
- [x] data-model.md - GalleryEntry and MarkdownOutput entities with execution flow
- [x] quickstart.md - Integration test scenarios with execution pipeline
- [x] contracts/cli-interface.md - con-duct-gallery CLI specification
- [x] CLAUDE.md - Agent context updated with Python 3.11+, con-duct, datalad
